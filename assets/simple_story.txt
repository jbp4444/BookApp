This is the start of the story.

There may be long, rambling passages that go here in order to:
* give background to the main character,
* give the setting of the story,
* show any supporting characters,
* give some idea about how to move around,
* explain what the goal is

aaa <<print either("foo","bar","baz") >> bbb 
<<print random(1,6) >> 
<<print foo >>

It may be so much text that you end up having to scroll down the screen to see it all.

Or maybe there will be multiple non-choice links to avoid having to scroll the screen.

For our story ...

There are two passages here.
* Would you like to take the [[Left]] passage?
* or the [[Right]] passage?
