:: Start
This is the start of the story.  

There may be long, rambling passages that go here in order to:
* give background to the main character,
* give the setting of the story,
* show supporting characters (if any),
* give some idea about how to move around,
* explain what the goal is  

It may be so much text that you end up having to 
scroll down the screen to see it all.

Or maybe there will be multiple non-choice links to
avoid having to scroll the screen.

For our story ...

There are two passages:
* Would you like to take the [[Left]] passage?
* or the [[Right]] passage?



:: Left
You chose the left passage.

You found a silver key!

<<set $hasSilverKey = 1>>

<<display 'GoToStart'>>



:: GoToStart
... go to [[Start]]



:: Right
You chose the right passage.

<<if $hasSilverKey>>
There is a door to another passage.  Your silver key fits the lock and opens it.
* Continue on to the [[Next]] passage
<<else>>
There is a locked door to another passage.
<<endif>>



:: Next
You made it to the final passage!

<<display 'GoToStart'>>
