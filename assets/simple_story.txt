This is the start of the story.

There may be long, rambling passages that go here in order to:
* give background to the main character,
* give the setting of the story,
* show any supporting characters,
* give some idea about how to move around,
* explain what the goal is

It may be so much text that you end up having to scroll down the screen to see it all.

Or maybe there will be multiple non-choice links to avoid having to scroll the screen.

For our story ...

There are two passages here.
* Would you like to take the [[Left]] passage?
* or the [[Right]] passage?
