:: Start
<img src='assets/image.png'> This is the start of the story.

There may be long, rambling passages that go here in order to:
<ul>
<li> give background to the main character,
<li> give the setting of the story,
<li> show any supporting characters,
<li> give some idea about how to move around,
<li> explain what the goal is
</ul>
<p>
It may be so much text that you end up having to
scroll down the screen to see it all.
<p>
Or maybe there will be multiple non-choice links to
avoid having to scroll the screen.
<p>
For our story ...
<p>
There are two passages here.
<ul>
<li> Would you like to take the [[Left]] passage?
<li> or the [[Right]] passage?
</ul>


:: Left
You chose the left passage.
<p>
You found a silver key!
<p>
<<set $hasSilverKey = 1>>

<<display 'GoToStart'>>



:: GoToStart

:: DrinkRed
You drank the Red potion!
<ul>
<li> Back to [[Next]]
</ul>



:: Right
You chose the right passage.
<p>
<<if $hasSilverKey>>
There is a door to another passage.  Your silver key fits the lock and opens it.
<ul>
<li> Continue on to the [[Next]] passage
</ul>
<<else>>
There is a locked door to another passage.
<<display 'GoToStart'>>
<<endif>>

<p>
There are two potions on a table, one is red and one is blue:
<<actions 'DrinkRed' 'DrinkBlue'>>

<<display 'GoToStart'>>

<ul>
